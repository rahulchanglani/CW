Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1,1,1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,...]
But what if we started with [0,0,1] as a signature? As starting with [0,1] instead of [1,1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

[0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n==0, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)
